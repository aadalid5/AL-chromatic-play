# Getting Started with Create React App

- `https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=63b312ff12ec9c24b15db580`

✔ Added script 'chromatic' to package.json
You can now run it here or in CI with 'npm run chromatic' or 'yarn chromatic'.

ℹ Your project token was added to the script via the --project-token flag.
If you're running Chromatic via continuous integration, we recommend setting
the CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN environment variable in your CI environment.
You can then remove the --project-token from your package.json script.`
